For their capstone project, they were challenged to come up with an initiative that would rectify the educational disparity existing between different neighborhoods in the city. They knew that they shared a common interest in reading, so they began to devise a solution that would connect their love for books with the greater good of the community. Noticing that they had many old books and unused textbooks lying around in their homes, most of which were in perfectly good condition, they sent out surveys to their friends and peers asking if they had the same problem. The results were clear: many books were in need of a new pair of hands. The two turned to local organizations, only to find that none of them clearly addressed this issue. So the two students took it upon themselves to create their own organization that establishes a redistribution channel transferring books from the households of previous owners to the hands of less fortunate communities.
