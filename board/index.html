My name is Taee, and I&#x27;m a junior currently attending Stuyvesant High School. I&#x27;m from Flushing, Queens, and I co-founded Second Hand as a way of sharing my love for reading with others in my community. I am so excited to work with my talented board members to achieve this goal, and I hope you can help us too by donating a book! If you couldn&#x27;t tell already, I like to read in my free time, but I also enjoy playing handball (American, not European) and watching movies. The most recent book I&#x27;ve read is Patron Saints of Nothing, which is about a Filipino-American teenager uncovering the truth about his cousin&#x27;s death (9/10, would recommend!)<!-- --> </p></div><div class="Board_special__36oAG"><h2>Joshua Lau</h2><img src="/josh.png"/><p>Hello everyone, my name is Joshua and I&#x27;m a junior at Townsend Harris High School. When I&#x27;m not in school, I spend most of my time listening to music, and well, reading. I feel that co-founding Second Hand has allowed me to take my passion for books and elevate it to something of greater importance. A book that reminds me of my childhood is The Giving Tree, as I vividly remember my parents reading it to me. Books create memories, and Second Hand will create opportunities for kids to form connections with books like I did when I was younger.</p></div></section><header class="Board_header__1yQiA"><h1>Our Board Members</h1></header><section class="Board_members__1KJng"><div><div class="Board_member__13GhL"><h2>Christina Shen</h2><img src="/christina.jpg"/><p>Social Media Director</p></div><p>Hey everyone! I&#x27;m Christina, currently a junior at Stuyvesant High School. I am so excited to be part of Second Hand as a social media director. I believe that this organization has great potential, and I am looking forward to working with everyone! I recently finished reading Interior Chinatown, a teleplay that points out the stereotypes in our society as well as what defines one&#x27;s identity. In my free time, I love to dance, binge watch Cdramas, hang out with friends, and try out new things.</p></div><div><p>Hey guys! I&#x27;m Rishima, and I&#x27;m a junior at Townsend Harris High School. I&#x27;m super excited to be a Social Media Director for Second Hand, and I am so honored to have been given this opportunity to help others strengthen their connection to reading and find not just a home but a community in literature. In my down time, I like to read (obviously!), go out with my friends, and cook new things. I recently read Lord of the Flies and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a thought-provoking classic.</p><div class="Board_member__13GhL"><h2>Rishima Pokharel</h2><img src="/rishima.jpg"/><p>Social Media Director</p></div></div><div><div class="Board_member__13GhL"><h2>Shafiul Haque</h2><img src="/Shafiul.jpg"/><p>Outreach Director</p></div><p>Hello everyone! My name is Shafiul Haque and I&#x27;m a junior at Stuyvesant High School. Some of my hobbies include reading, playing sports, and biking. As the outreach director of Second Hand, I&#x27;ll be responsible for keeping in touch with our recipient locations and partner organizations. I am very excited to be a part of Second Hand because I believe that our community will benefit tremendously from the outpour of books. Personally, I love reading fantasy and adventure books, and I&#x27;m currently reading the City of Fallen Angels, the fourth book in the Mortal Instrument series. The book is about a girl who discovers her own heritage and her family history in the world of magic.<!-- --> </p></div><div><p>Hey everyone! My name&#x27;s Darian and I&#x27;m a junior at Townsend Harris High School. As Second Hand&#x27;s volunteer coordinator, I am excited to work with all of you and use my passion for volunteering to bring books to those who need them. In my free time I enjoy playing music and cubing. My favorite book of all time would have to be Prisoner B-3087. It was one of the first books I read from cover to cover in one weekend, and it provided a basis for my love of history.</p><div class="Board_member__13GhL"><h2>Darian Jimenez</h2><img src="/darian.jpg"/><p>Volunteer Coordinator</p></div></div><div><div class="Board_member__13GhL"><h2>Claire Grumbacher</h2><img src="/claire.jpg"/><p>Secretary</p></div><p>Hello! My name is Claire Grumbacher. I am a sophomore at Francis Lewis High School in Queens, New York. To me, the idea of learning something on your own is absolutely incredible and books are the perfect tool to access that very skill. In my free time, I (of course) enjoy reading, but I also love playing the guitar, crocheting, and connecting with others. Currently, I am reading a book that quenches my thirst for a political and science fiction dystopian called 1984, which recounts the captivating story of George Orwell.</p></div><div><p>Hello everyone!
